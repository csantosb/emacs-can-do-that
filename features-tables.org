| 01 | Balance Inward/Outward                        | You can select a whole tag in VS Code by using the balance inward and balance outward Emmet commands. It's helpful to bind these commands to keyboard shortcuts, like Ctrl + Shift + Up Arrow for Balance Outward and Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow for Balance Inward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region.el]] can do that. Just expand until it selects the whole tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 02 | Pull Requests                                 | The Github Pull Requests extension from Github allows you to view and interact with your Pull Requests directly from within VS Code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Use ~magit~ : https://magit.vc/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 03 | Toggle Sidebar Focus                          | You can navigate in and out of the sidebar without ever touching the mouse. Use ⌃/⌘+ 0 to set focus to the Siebar and ⌃/⌘+ 1 to set it to the editor. On a Mac, you can use ⌃/⌘+ ⇣ to select a file in the Sidebar Explorer with your keyboard. On Windows just press the enter key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ~M-x o~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 04 | Breadcrumbs                                   | This tip is brought to you by Brian Holt. Use the Breadcrumbs feature in VS Code to quickly jump between folders, files and even sections in code without ever leaving your current tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ~doom-modeline~ ? https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline ~C-x C-f~ or ~find-files~ allows one to open easily files on the same folder or on higher level folders using auto completion.                                                                                             |
| 05 | Slack Chat                                    | The Slack Chat extension for VS Code embeds a chat window in the editor. This is paticularly useful for chatting during Live Share sessions. It has the added benefit of being able to start a Live Share session with the "/live share" command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Use EMACS slack client :  https://github.com/yuya373/emacs-slack                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 06 | Soft Undo                                     | Use the Soft Undo (⌘/⌃ + U) to move the cursor back to it's previous location. This is particularly useful when you need to move down in a long file to copy a variable or function name and then go back to your original position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Use the mark ring. Use ~C-SPC C-SPC~ to add a mark to the ring, ~C-u C-SPC~ to go back to the last mark. Helm ~helm-mark-ring~ allows you to see and navigate on the whole ring, instead of one element at a time. Use the global mark ring, to get the same effect on multiple buffers. |
| 07 | Share your localhost                          | This tip is brought to you by Jonathan Carter. VS Code Live Share enables you to share any TCP process on your computer with people who are currently connected to your Live Share session. Choose "Share Server" from the Command Palette and select a port to share. Now they can access your localhost like it's their localhost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 08 | JavaScript Scratch Pad                        | Use the Quokka.js extension to create a JavaScript scratchpad that executes JavaScript/TypeScript as you type it with output in the terminal and inline with VS Code. Note that this is based on a paid service, but there is a free plan that works by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ~M-x eshell~ then ~$ node~ . (And it's based on free services !)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 09 | Version Lense                                 | This tip is brought to you by Elijah Manor. Easily see what npm packages are out of date with the Version Lense plugin. Toggle errors and warnings on and off as well as updating to the latest available version of a package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10 | Search User Settings                          | There are over 400 settings in VS Code, and that doesn't include settings for extensions. VS Code uses a search AI that helps you find what you need, even if you aren't sure exactly what you're looking for. Just search settings the way that you would search the internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ~M-x~ customize                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11 | Refactor To ES6                               | VS Code can refactor your JavaScript to ES6. It can update imports, convert prototype functions to ES6 classes and more. Anytime you see an ellipsis, you may be able to refactor that code. Check the lightbulb to find out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | JS2-refactor: https://github.com/magnars/js2-refactor.el                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 13 | Move Side Bar Right                           | The code we write left-aligned by default. When the sidebar is on the left, expanding and collapsing it causes the jarring effect of moving the code in the viewport. Keeping the Side Bar on the right ensures that the viewport always stays the same. The Side Bar in VS Code can be collapsed with ⌘/⌃ + B. It can be moved to the right-hand side by selecting 'View / Move Side Bar Right".                                                                                                                                                                     | In Emacs by the default new horizontal windows ~C-x 3~ are created on the right.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 14 | Toggle Activity Bar                           | You might know that the Sidebar can be toggled with Cmd/Ctrl B. The ActivityBar can also be toggled to make even more room. The Multi-Key Extension allows for multiple commands to be bound to a single keystroke. This keystroke can then hide both the sidebar and the activity bar at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | You can hide emacs graphical elements quite easily with a couple of lines of Elisp [[https://gist.github.com/maurelio1234/8b045822f8abe39eaeba9f786585dd14][(Example)]]                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It also works in CSS properties like `background-image`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
